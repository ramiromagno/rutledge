Description: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data
    by Rutledge et al. (2004) <doi:10.1093/nar/gnh177> in tidy format. The
    data comprises a six-point, ten-fold dilution series, repeated in five
    independent runs, for two different amplicons. In each run, each standard
    concentration is replicated four times. For the original raw data file see
    the Supplementary Data section:
