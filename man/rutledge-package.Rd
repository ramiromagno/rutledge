\title{rutledge: Real-Time PCR Data Sets by Rutledge et al. (2004)}
\description{
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data by Rutledge et al. (2004) \doi{10.1093/nar/gnh177} in tidy format. The data comprises a six-point, ten-fold dilution series, repeated in five independent runs, for two different amplicons. In each run, each standard concentration is replicated four times. For the original raw data file see the Supplementary Data section: \url{https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/32/22/e178/2375678#supplementary-data}.
